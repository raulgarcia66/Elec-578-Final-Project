PROVISIONAL

New Methods We Could Add/Swap:
Trees and Random Forests (has complicated minimization problems?)
Forward Additive Stagewise Modeling?

Raul:
Done - Kernel Ridge Regression
Done - Logistic Regression with Iterative Algorithm (Multinomial too?)
Done - Proximal gradient descent with l1-penalty
Done - Elastic net (see homework for connection to prox. gradient descent)
Done - Support Vector Machine (in constraint form)
Done - Kernel SVM
Bagging procedure (procedure, not function)
Neural network? (regression and classification; training on MNIST)
Others:
Done - Bootstrapping function
Centering data function?

Jonathan:
Done - Gradient Descent
Done - Newton's Method
Done - Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
Naive Bayes Classifier
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Kernel PCA
Multidimensional Scaling
tSNE
UMAP
K-Means Clustering
PCA + K-Means
Hierarchical Clustering (how to create dendrogram?)
Adaboost
Gradient Boosting
